# Profanity Filter using LSTM

This repository contains code for a deep learning model that can filter out profanity in text. The model is implemented using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and is trained on a dataset of labeled examples.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Gradio
- cuML
- cuDF
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage

To use the profanity filter, you can run the `app.py` script. This will launch a web interface using Gradio that allows you to enter text and see whether it contains profanity or not.
